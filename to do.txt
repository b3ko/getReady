to do:

- get icons of the actual tasks
- clock should be a count down clock from log in time to bus departure
	- two modes (hours and minutes / minutes e.g. 1:15 vs 75)
- maybe have parents choose times a task needs to be completed by, if child is running late item turns red (too much configuration for parent? possible upgrade?)
- mysql db
- login model
- welcome / comfim email
- configuration page
	- hide/display icons
	- change time of bus
	- change method of transportation (bus, car, walk)
- save configuration to db
- multiple configurations per account, so name for each config



flow:
1 - show default with config light box
2 - if no email - enter email (twice)
3 - send welcome email with link
4 - once coming from link, if no values in db, user sees config
5 - choose which icons to hide, change default time, name, etc
6 - on save, save to database
7 - anytime coming from that link show values from the db

other:
- forgot link - resends link, must have access to that email address
- links encrypted combo of email, name of config that was saved and some other random or unique thing?
